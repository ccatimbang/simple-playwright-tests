## What is Being Tested

### Application Components
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript application with authentication and todo management
- **Backend**: Node.js Express API with JWT authentication and CRUD operations
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflows between frontend and backend

### Core Functionality
1. **Authentication System**
   - User login with valid/invalid credentials
   - JWT token management and validation
   - Session persistence using localStorage
   - Logout functionality and state cleanup

2. **Todo Management**
   - Create new todos with title and description
   - Read/display existing todos with timestamps
   - Update todo details (title, description, completion status)
   - Delete todos with confirmation
   - Visual state management (completed vs pending)
   - Form validation and error handling
